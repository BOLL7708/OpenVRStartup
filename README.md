# OpenVRStartup
Automatically run command files on SteamVR startup, download the latest release [here](https://github.com/BOLL7708/OpenVRStartup/releases).

# Usage
1. Decompress the release archive to a folder on disk.
2. Run the _.exe_ file in the folder.
3. Follow the instructions provided in the console window to add the application to always launch with SteamVR.
4. Check the _.log_ file that is generated in the same folder, it should provide information about the execution.
5. Edit the example _.cmd_ file, delete it, add new ones. You can add as many as you like and the application will attemp to run them all.

Delete the generated _.log_ file to get the instructions in step 3 again on the next launch.

That's pretty much it. This is a very simple application, and it will terminate as soon as it has launched all your scripts so it's not even running in the background.
